<h2>About Mapping Diversity</h2>

<a href="https://mappingdiversity.eu/">Mapping Diversity</a> is a platform for discovering key facts about diversity and representation in street names across Europe, and to spark a debate about who is missing from our urban spaces.

You can explore this initiative on the dedicated website, <a href="https://mappingdiversity.eu/">mappingdiversity.eu</a>. A pilot version of the project focused on Italy is also <a href="https://italy.mappingdiversity.eu/">available online</a>.

For an explanation of the technical details involved, see the post <a href="https://medium.com/european-data-journalism-network/the-messy-data-sources-behind-mapping-diversity-3cc7338b8b84">The messy data sources behind “Mapping diversity”</a>.

<h2>About this interface</h2>

The web app you are using is called `streetnamer`. It facilitates matching street names to the person or entity a given street is dedicated to. <a href="https://github.com/EDJNet/streetnamer">`streetnamer`</a> is open source; you can run it locally on your computer or deploy it customising its behaviour. It has been developed by <a href="https://github.com/giocomai/">Giorgio Comai</a>, researcher and data analyst at <a href="https://balcanicaucaso.org/">OBCT/CCI</a>, within the scope of <a href="https://europeandatajournalism.eu/">EDJNet, the European Data Journalism Network</a>. 

<h2>Copyright and acknowledgments</h2>

Street names are retrieved from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStretMap</a> (OSM). Thank you ©OpenStreetMap contributors! OpenStreetMap data are licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).

Names and delimitation of Local adminsitrative units have been retrieved from <a href="https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/lau/download/">Eurostat's gisco services</a>. We are requested to include the following notice: © EuroGeographics for the administrative boundaries (we would much prefer that these datasets be distributed as open data with an open license, but thank you any way!). 

All information retrieved from Wikidata is in the public domain (CC-0). Cheers to that, and thank you Wikidata contributors!

Matching between street names and Wikidata identifiers (and other information added through this interface) has been done by members of the European Data Journalism Network (EDJNet). Thank you all so much for your effort and patience!

As we open this interface to the public, we want thank all of you who will contribute. 

To the extent that it is possible, we attach no new copyright to the matching itself in order to facilitate reuse of these data. If you use these data, we kindly ask you to acknowledge its source and include a reference to EDJNet and mappingdiversity.eu.

<h3>What happens to the data you collect?</h3>

The data collected through this interface have been used extensively by EDJNet. You can use them too!

Long term, it would be nice to integrate these data with Wikidata and OpenStreetMap themselves, and possibly combine them with other similar efforts, but we are still unsure about the best way to go about this, both in technical terms as well as the additional data checks that would be required. Licensing issues should also be considered (e.g. stemming from OSM's data ODbL).
