<h2>About Mapping Diversity</h2>

<a href="https://mappingdiversity.eu/">Mapping Diversity</a> is a platform for discovering key facts about diversity and representation in street names across Europe, and to spark a debate about who is missing from our urban spaces.

You can explore this initiative on the dedicated website, <a href="https://mappingdiversity.eu/">mappingdiversity.eu</a>. A pilot version of the project focused on Italy is also <a href="https://italy.mappingdiversity.eu/">available online</a>.

<h2>About this interface</h2>

The web app you are using is called `streetnamer`. It facilitates matching street names to the person or entity a given street is dedicated to. <a href="https://github.com/EDJNet/streetnamer">`streetnamer`</a> is open source; you can run it locally on your computer or deploy it customising its behaviour. It has been developed by <a href="https://github.com/giocomai/">Giorgio Comai</a>, researcher and data analyst at <a href="https://balcanicaucaso.org/">OBCT/CCI</a>, within the scope of <a href="https://europeandatajournalism.eu/">EDJNet, the European Data Journalism Network</a>. 

If you have suggesions or encounter issues, you are welcome to report them <a href"https://github.com/EDJNet/streetnamer/issues">in the dedicated page</a>.
