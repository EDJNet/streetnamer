<h2>How to contribute?</h2>

When you match a street to an entity, you are answering the question: to whom or to what is this street named after?

The goal is to associate each street with a Wikidata entity whenever this is relevant. 

If the relevant Wikidata entry does not exist:
<ul>
  <li>
consider adding it to Wikidata :-) - it is easy to join and contribute  
  </li>
<li>
you may still be able to contribute through this interface by answering a few basic questions: if this street is dedicated to a person or not, and if yes, the presumed gender of the person (typically, if no other information is known, sex assigned at birth) and the broad category you feel best applies to that individual. If you don't know, leave the relevant fields empty.   
</li>

</ul>
