<h2>How to contribute?</h2>

When you match a street to an entity, you are answering the question: to whom or to what is this street named after?

The goal is to associate each street with a Wikidata entity whenever this is relevant. 

Given the large amount of streets, we prioritise giving information about human beings starting from underrepresented groups such as women, but we welcome contributions about all entities.

If the relevant Wikidata entry does not exist:
<ul>
  <li>
consider adding it to Wikidata :-) - it is easy to join and contribute  
  </li>
<li>
you may still be able to contribute through this interface by answering a few basic questions: if this street is dedicated to a person or not, and if yes, the presumed gender of the person (typically, if no other information is known, sex assigned at birth) and the broad category you feel best applies to that individual. If you don't know, leave the relevant fields empty.   
</li>

</ul>


<h2>Clarifications</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
whenever possible, think about the origin of the street name. For example, if a street in Italy is dedicated to "25 April" (1945), it is clear that is not dedicated to a random date of the year (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2531">April 25 / Q2531</a>), but rather to the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q112686476">liberation of Italy from nazi-fascism</a>, Wikidata identifier <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q112686476">Q112686476</a>. Unless it is very close to the place itself, a street in Italy dedicated to "Monte Grappa" is not effectively dedicated to this rather unremarcable mountain massif, but rather to the important <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2895260">Battle of Monte Grappa</a> that took place there during the first World War, Wikidata identifier <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2895260">Q112686476</a>. 
  </li>

</ul>  

<h2>Other sources and options for contributing</h2>

OpenStreetMap has a dedicated field for the etymology of street names: if you have an OSM account, you can contribute easily via <a href="https://mapcomplete.osm.be/etymology.html">MapComplete</a> (this source is currently not active used by MappingDiversity, but may be in the future).
